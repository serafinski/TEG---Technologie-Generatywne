For investment banking professionals, the implications are clear: proficiency with genAI tools is quickly becoming essential. [...] Yet, despite the technology’s potential, only 17% of banks currently use genAI for risk management, with U.S. banks leading in adoption compared to their EMEA and APAC counterparts. One example: Goldman Sachs uses a genAI risk management system specifically designed to spot and mitigate emerging risks. [...] Investment banking relies on vast amounts of real-time financial data. By integrating genAI into financial research, firms can make more informed decisions, respond to market developments faster, and gain a competitive edge in deal-making and advisory work. To support this, investment banks are deploying a mix of internally developed genAI tools, enterprise-grade platforms, and, in some cases, consumer-grade applications — each suited for different use cases and expectations around security,\", \"score\": 0.7781275}, {\"title\": \"Generative AI in Banking: Real Use Cases & 11 Banks Using AI\", \"url\": \"https://masterofcode.com/blog/generative-ai-in-banking\", \"content\": \"While the technology is enhancing customer-facing services, it’s also making significant strides in the realm of investment banking and capital markets.

However, the mission of banks is to ensure the accessibility of services. This should be true regardless of one’s net worth or literacy.
